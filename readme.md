# Quiz Web App Training Path

This app is a starting point for a quiz web app that can be built using Copilot's assistance. The goal was to create a simple quiz game with multiple-choice questions and a scoring system. The app will have a game over screen that displays the final score after all rounds are completed. It can be further enhanced with features like a timer, progress bar, categories, levels, user authentication, leaderboard, sound effects, hints, lifelines, multiplayer mode, question feedback, mobile responsiveness, and social sharing. Check out the steps below to build a feature-rich quiz web app.

## Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
    - Ask the assistant to build a basic quiz web app.
    - Rules:
        - 1 question with 4 possible answers (only 1 correct) per round.
        - 1 point per correct answer.
        - 10 rounds in total.
    - Note: The initial response may be a single HTML file with hard-coded questions (usually 2 or 3).

2. **Separation of Concerns**
    - Refactor the code to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into different files for better maintainability and readability.

3. **Game Over Screen**
    - Add a game over screen that displays the final score after all rounds are completed.

4. **Logic Consistency**
    - Ensure there is no discrepancy between the condition for the end screen and the number of questions.

5. **External API Integration**
    - Integrate an external API to fetch questions dynamically, replacing the hard-coded questions.

6. **Enhancement of the game over screen**
    - Modify the game over screen to display the user's score and the correct, as well as the selected answers for all questions.
  
7. **Further feature enhancement ideas**
    - Add a timer for each question.
    - Implement a countdown timer for the entire quiz.
    - Add a progress bar to indicate the user's progress through the quiz.
    - Include a "Skip" button to move to the next question without answering the current one.
    - Categories and Levels: Add different categories and difficulty levels for questions.
    - User Authentication: Implement user authentication to save scores and track progress.
    - Leaderboard: Display the top scores of all users.
    - Sound Effects: Add sound effects for correct and incorrect answers.
    - Hints and Lifelines: Provide hints or lifelines (like 50/50, ask a friend) to help users answer difficult questions.
    - Multiplayer Mode: Implement a multiplayer mode where users can compete against each other.
    - Question feedback: Provide feedback on the correct answer after each question.
    - Mobile Responsiveness: Make the app responsive for mobile devices.
    - Social Sharing: Allow users to share their scores on social media platforms.

By following these steps, you will create a robust and engaging quiz web app with a clean and maintainable codebase.
