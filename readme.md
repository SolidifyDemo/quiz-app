# Quiz Web App Training Path

Follow this training path to build a fully functional quiz web app. Each step builds upon the previous one, enhancing the app's functionality and user experience.

## Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
    - Ask the assistant to build a basic quiz web app.
    - Rules:
        - 1 question with 4 possible answers (only 1 correct) per round.
        - 1 point per correct answer.
        - 10 rounds in total.
    - Note: The initial response may be a single HTML file with hard-coded questions (usually 2 or 3).

2. **Separation of Concerns**
    - Refactor the code to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into different files for better maintainability and readability.

3. **Game Over Screen**
    - Add a game over screen that displays the final score after all rounds are completed.

4. **Logic Consistency**
    - Ensure there is no discrepancy between the condition for the end screen and the number of questions.

5. **External API Integration**
    - Integrate an external API to fetch questions dynamically, replacing the hard-coded questions.

6. **Further Enhancements**
    - Continue to improve the app with additional features and optimizations as needed.

By following these steps, you will create a robust and engaging quiz web app with a clean and maintainable codebase.
